**Introduction**

Quantum computing has the potential to elevate heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) to new
levels, helping to address some of the main computational challenges currently faced by the industry, and enabling solutions to problems that are currently intractable for purely classical supercomputers. This paradigm shift necessitates the integration of quantum processing units (QPUs) alongside traditional computing architectures, such as CPUs, GPUs, and other specialized accelerators (e.g., AIUs). The emerging quantum-centric supercomputing (QCSC) model represents a crucial step toward achieving quantum advantage: the point at which quantum computers become the best solution for solving a given computational problem. Reaching quantum advantage will require collaboration between multiple industries to align efforts in hardware and software integration.

This workshop will provide a forum for researchers, industry professionals, and HPC practitioners to discuss and explore the latest developments in QCSC. We will examine state-of-the-art solutions used in heterogeneous computing today and investigate how QPUs can be seamlessly incorporated into existing HPC frameworks. The workshop will highlight how hybrid quantum-classical algorithms can leverage these architectures and pave the way for practical quantum advantage.

**Background and Motivation**

As quantum computing matures, integrating QPUs into high-performance computing environments has become a key challenge. While traditional HPC systems have well-established ecosystems—including optimized libraries, job schedulers, and performance monitoring tools—adapting these tools to accommodate quantum-classical hybrid workloads is needed for the next evolution of HPC to take place. The integration must ensure minimal disruption to existing infrastructures while maximizing performance gains.
Several industries, including pharmaceuticals, materials science, finance, and AI, are beginning to explore quantum computing’s potential. However, the practical integration of these dissimilar resources requires efficient co-processing between quantum and classical hardware, necessitating advances in:

* **Hardware integration**: developing interfaces that allow QPUs to efficiently communicate with CPUs/GPUs. 
* **Software compatibility**: ensuring that quantum software stacks interact seamlessly with HPC middleware and job schedulers.
* **Algorithm optimization**: designing hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that take full advantage of QCSC architectures. This workshop will bring together experts from quantum computing, classical HPC, and software development to address these pressing issues.
