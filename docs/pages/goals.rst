Workshop goals (LSQCC)
######################

This workshop aims to shift the focus from early-stage quantum-HPC integration to **achieving quantum advantage through scalable, hybrid quantum-classical computing**. 
Attendees will gain insight into how quantum processing units (QPUs) can be effectively integrated within heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) environments, with a strong emphasis on real-world applications, algorithmic advancements, and hardware scalability. 
**This workshop will showcase concrete results, industry-led solutions, and the latest research on quantum-centric supercomputing (QCSC)**.

A key goal is to bridge industry and academia, providing a state-of-the-art view of QCSC implementations through real- world case studies and best practices for integrating quantum computing into existing HPC workflows. The workshop will also highlight scalability in quantum hardware, demonstrating tangible pathways for expanding QPU capabilities, including advancements in couplers and system-wide performance improvements. Additionally, it will focus on hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, presenting evidence of their impact within QCSC architectures and introducing benchmarking methodologies to evaluate quantum advantage in practical HPC applications.

To ensure lasting impact, the workshop will provide practical artifacts, including tools, frameworks, and methodologies for QCSC development, with findings consolidated into a whitepaper or best-practices guide to support ongoing industry and research efforts.
